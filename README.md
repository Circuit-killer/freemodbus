==========

FreeModbus library rework.

This is a rework of freemodbus library for embedded systems (http://freemodbus.org/) originally written by Christian Walter <wolti@sil.at>.

Goals of this rework:
* Replace hungarian notation in code to respond Linux kernel coding guidelines
* Update AVR port (since it uses poisoned code)
* Create STM32 port
* Make library useable with Antares build environment (https://github.com/nekromant/antares)
